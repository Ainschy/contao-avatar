Credits to thorstenpanknin for:

Credits to leo for:

- Avatar now available as frontend form field and directly in frontend
  member settings.
  
- Inline javascript removed from the templates, now form enctype is set to
  multipart by TYPOlight internally.
  
- The avatar widgets in frontend and backend my now also be used for other
  purpose such as company logo for example, because of new DCA eval options:
  
  filename => 'myfilename_%s'  // custom file name, %s replaced by record id
  maxdims => 80                // maximum image dimension w x h
  maxsize => 10000             // maximum image file size in bytes
